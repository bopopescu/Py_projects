Pytest syntax for writing tests-
1. File names should start with “test_”, or end with "_test".
2. If tests are defined as methods on a class, the class name should start with “Test".
    The class should not have an __init__ method.
3. Test method names or function names should start with “test_”.
Methods with names that don’t match this pattern won’t be executed as tests.

python -m pytest -v

2) Run tests by substring matching
pytest -k method2 -v

2) Run tests by markers @pytest.mark
pytest -m set1

3) parallel test
pytest -n 4 -v

4) @pytest.fixture
Fixtures can be used to share test data between tests, execute setup and teardown methods before
and after test executions respectively.

function defined in fixture will run once before each test function.

import pytest
@pytest.fixture
def get_sum_test_data():
        return [(3,5,8), (-2,-2,-4), (-1,5,4), (3,-5,-2), (0,5,5)]
def test_sum(get_sum_test_data):
        for data in get_sum_test_data:
                num1 = data[0]
                num2 = data[1]
                expected = data[2]
                assert sum(num1, num2) == expected

** Scope of fixture- Scope controls how often a fixture gets called. The default is function.
Here are the options for scope:
function: Run once per test
class: Run once per class of tests
module: Run once per module
session: Run once per session

5) define @pytest.fixture in  conftest.py so multiple test_.py
can use it

6) Parameterized tests
@pytest.mark.parametrize("input1, input2, output",[(5,5,10),(3,5,12)])


@pytest.fixture(scope='session')
def get_sum_test_data():
        return [(3,5,8), (-2,-2,-4), (-1,5,4), (3,-5,-2), (0,5,5)]
@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def setup_and_teardown():
        print '\nFetching data from db'
        yield
        print '\nSaving test run data in db'
def test_sum(get_sum_test_data):
        for data in get_sum_test_data:
                num1 = data[0]
                num2 = data[1]
                expected = data[2]
                assert sum(num1, num2) == expected

7) Test case markings
7) Xfail / Skip tests

execute tests with recording either pass or fail status
@pytest.mark.xfail

completely skip test
@pytest.mark.skip

****
The builtin pytest.mark.parametrize decorator enables parametrization of arguments for a test function.
We have passed following parameters to it-
argnames — a comma-separated string denoting one or more argument names, or a list/tuple of argument strings.
Here, we have passed num1, num2 and expected as 1st input , 2nd input and expected sum respectively.
argvalues — The list of argvalues determines how often a test is invoked with different argument values.
If only one argname was specified argvalues is a list of values. If N argnames were specified,
argvalues must be a list of N-tuples, where each tuple-element specifies a value for its respective argname.
Here, we have passed a tuple of (3,5,8) inside a list where 3 is num1,5 isnum2 and 8is expected sum.

@pytest.mark.parametrize('num1, num2, expected',[(3,5,8), (-2,-2,-4), (-1,5,4), (3,-5,-2), (0,5,5)])
def test_sum(num1, num2, expected):
        assert sum(num1, num2) == expected

In above code, we have passed the values of 2nd argument(which are actual test data) directly there.
We can also make a function call to get those values.
import pytest
def get_sum_test_data():
        return [(3,5,8), (-2,-2,-4), (-1,5,4), (3,-5,-2), (0,5,5)]
@pytest.mark.parametrize('num1, num2, expected',get_sum_test_data())
def test_sum(num1, num2, expected):
        assert sum(num1, num2) == expected

Summary
In this pytest tutorial, we covered

Install pytest using pip install pytest=2.9.1
Simple pytest program and run it with py.test command.
Assertion statements, assert x==y, will return either True or False.
How pytest identifies test files and methods.
Test files starting with test_ or ending with _test
Test methods starting with test
py.test command will run all the test files in that folder and subfolders. To run a specific file, we can use the command py.test <filename>
Run a subset of test methods
Grouping of test names by substring matching.
py.test -k <name> -v will run all the tests having <name> in its name.
Run test by markers.Mark the tests using @pytest.mark.<name> and run the tests using pytest -m <name> to run tests marked as <name>.
Run tests in parallel
Install pytest-xdist using pip install pytest-xdist
Run tests using py.test -n NUM where NUM is the number of workers
Creating fixture methods to run code before every test by marking the method with @pytest.fixture
The scope of a fixture method is within the file it is defined.
A fixture method can be accessed across multiple test files by defining it in conftest.py file.
A test method can access a fixture by using it as an input argument.
Parametrizing tests to run it against multiple set of inputs.
@pytest.mark.parametrize("input1, input2, output",[(5,5,10),(3,5,12)]) def test_add(input1, input2, output):
assert input1+input2 == output,"failed"
will run the test with inputs (5,5,10) and (3,5,12)
Skip/xfail tests using @pytets.mark.skip and @pytest.mark.xfail
Create test results in XML format which covers executed test details using py.test test_sample1.py -v --junitxml="result.xml"
A sample pytest framework to test an API
