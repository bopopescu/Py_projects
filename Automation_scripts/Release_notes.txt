Things changed since previous check-in: 
1. User is supposed to create a new folder on C:\ drive. The folder structure is as follows:
   i] Create a folder called "QA_files" under C:\ drive.
  ii] Then copy the QA_config.txt file from SVN to this folder
 iii] Then create two sub folders inside this folder namely "Packages" and "Setup_files". 
  iv] Every new package will be copied and extraced to "C:\QA_files\Packages" folder post this change.
   v] Also, please place all the necessory files like Path_Loss, flow files under the main folder "C:\QA_files\Setup_files". Keep in mind to create sub-folder inside this "C:\QA_files\Setup_files" folder for the necessory package files for each new package you wish to QA.


2. Added code to read the config file and store the values in variables. Thus, no need to give arguments on command line as earlier. 

3. Adding "QA_config.txt" file to the SVN. This file shows the working template for IQmeasure station. User is supposed to change the values as per station to be able to run the scripts. 

4. Changed the path were setup files were stored from previously on network to now local on C:\ drive.
The change is in "Source_Executable_path" in Run_QA.py file.  

5. Added code to take care of case-sensitiveness of the values entered in QA config file. 

6. Changed the folder name in code where the packages will be copied and extracted on local machine. 
The change is in "Destination_Package_dir" variable in Run_PKG_Installation.py file.

7. Email will be sent out for every exception that is encountered during the Automation process to the primary owner of the station notifying the Summary of the error and requesting action to be taken to fix the issue.

8. Email notification will be send to Jian along with Primary owner of the station only in the case when there is new package found and the process for installation has started. In all the other cases, only the primary owner will be notified with an email.

Notes updated corresponding to check-in as of 11/26/2013
9. Create a folder named C:\QA_files\QA_Automation_Scripts under the C:\QA_files folder. Download all the Automation_scripts from SVN in this folder. This will act as the same path from where you will be running your Python scripts from this time onwards.

10. Added Automation script named "Automation_Setup_installer.au3". This script uses AutoItv3 tool to run and takes care of installation of Visual C++ 2005, Visual C++ 2008 and MATLAB Compiler Runtime 7.9 for new package.

11. Download and Install the new software setups added in the Python_install folder. These setups are : 
    i] autoit-v3-setup.exe
   ii] SciTE4AutoIt3.exe
   
12. Added new code to take care of the package detection on the network. This takes into account the type of package detected. 
    Important Note: Package of type "Dongle" and "Lock" are not installed on the machine. If the database query detects that the package type is either "Dongle" or "Lock", the Test Id for that package is changed from '1' to '0' and the installation part is skipped.
	
13. Also, added one more email notification part when the package type is "Dongle" or "Lock" is detected. User is notified that the package is of one of this type and the Installation is skipped.

14. Changed the package_type naming convention that is followed based on which package is detected. This parameter is then passed to Run_PKG_Installation.py script.
