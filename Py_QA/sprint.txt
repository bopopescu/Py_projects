You: I was wondering the charge for texting and data between US and Poland
Steffy K: I appreciate you have initiated the chat and brought your concern to my attention.
Steffy K: I will be happy to review your account
Steffy K: and assist you with it.
Steffy K: Please give me a moment to review your account.
Steffy K: Thanks so much for your kind patience and allowing me enough time to get this checked.
You: sure
Steffy K: You have free global roaming service + premium international service which allows you calls at $0.20/min , texts for free and data $0.30/MB. There is nothing extra you need to do.
Steffy K: Just tell her two important things to do when she arrives there:
You: She is already there
Steffy K: Oh I see.
Steffy K: Then tell her to do:
Steffy K: 1) Under settings enable roaming service
Steffy K: and 2 ) have a good time there , the weather is awesome currently there.
You: How does she know she is using the premium feature or not
Steffy K: It is activated already... which means like regular cellular service what she uses in the states, can use there
Steffy K: Nothing special to do.
You: so she will not get charged for texting, but will be charged for serfing the internet
Steffy K: You got it absolutely right.
You: Okay, thanks

You: Under "Cellular Data Options", they have one more options is called Data Roaming
You: Currently it is set off
Steffy K: That's the one. Turn it on please.
You: If it is set off, will she be able to do texting?
You: Since we don't want to use data
Steffy K: It must be turned on to use the benefit of global roaming + premium international service.
You: But she was able to send me texts already
Steffy K: If it remains off, she may get charged for regular charges.
You: Okay, thanks.

Agent Jerwin M. enters chat
Jerwin M.: Thanks for your time and I appreciate your patience waiting.
You: Hi
You: My wife is in poland and her number is 415-812-8212
Jerwin M.: Hi there!
Jerwin M.: How may I help you with today?
You: We exchanged text messages, and she probably checked emails too, wondering if you can check her usage since 6/11 to see if there is extra charges
Jerwin M.: Sure that's not a problem.
Jerwin M.: I know it's important for you to check your wife's usage.
Jerwin M.: Nothing to worry, I can definitely assist you the best possible way that I could. Let me go ahead and access your account.
Jerwin M.: Thanks for waiting.
You: sure
Jerwin M.: I did checked the account and found out Sprint Global is free inculeded on your wife's line.0
Jerwin M.: She can use data and unlimited text while she's outside the US fo rfree
Jerwin M.: Voice calls are only $0.25/minute to select countries.
You: But I heard that the premium data plan is not free, how do does she know if she is using the basic or premium one when she serfs internet
Jerwin M.: With this feature you won't missed any sweet messages from each other..
Jerwin M.: Premium data is not added on her line. Still , it's not a problem since she has unlimited data up-to-2G.
Jerwin M.: It's up to her if she wants to add high speed data and I double check that she's currently using the basic one.
You: I see so she has 2G free data when she is in Poland
You: with current plan
Jerwin M.: Exactly! If there's wifi available in her location in Poland, you may suggest her to connect the phone instead of using the mobile data.
Jerwin M.: That will let her use fast internet service.
You: that's clear. Thanks. One more question, does she need to make setting changes on her phone to enable the sprint global roaming?
Jerwin M.: Good question.
Jerwin M.: You may just tell her to turn on data roaming on her iphone.
Jerwin M.: And that's it!
You: I am pretty sure she didnot do that and we exchanged text messages. That's why I was wondering the text messages she sent me probably are not free
Jerwin M.: Here's the steps : Settings > Cellular data options > Data Roaming
Jerwin M.: Basically service for text/data/calls will not work without her turning on the roaming.
Jerwin M.: Meaning to say its already enabled. No worries.
You: That's wonderful! Thanks so much. I will double - check with her for enabling the roaming.
You: Have a great day !!!!

Send MessageYou Have a great day !!!!
