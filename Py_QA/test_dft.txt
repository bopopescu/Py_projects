. write test plans and test matrix and perfomr end to end IQfact connectivity test. , RF measurement
. implement test coverage in c++ functions to perfomr end to end IQfact connectivity test
. detailed functional test to verfy instrument control and measurement logic.

Synchronous Parallel Test  to test simultaneously test multiple device.


A typical API doc has all the information related to the API like its request format, 
response, error codes, resource, mandatory parameters, optional parameters, headers, 
etc. The doc can be maintained in various tools like Swagger which is open source.
After that, try to write service-level cases for the API. For example, if an API 
takes n parameters to get the response in which m are mandatory parameters and 
others are optional, then one test case should be to try different combinations 
of parameters and verify the response. Another test case might verify the headers 
and try to run API without passing authentication and verify the error code.
Next comes the step of integration testing, where you need to test the API and all 
its dependent APIs or functions. This also includes testing API response, the data 
it should return to another API or method and what happens if this API fails.
Once the API is stable and functional testing is almost done, the tester can perform 
load, security and performance testing.
